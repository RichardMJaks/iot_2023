# Reflection 2

During the lecture I learned a bit more about the structure of the cloud and it's connections to home devices, and how some devices aren't a part of the internet technically. We also learned about a few connections, which most looked like a VGA connection. I also found out most of them are useless for modern data transfer speeds, as their speeds are limited to only a few hundred kilobytes, or at best a few megabytes.

Later on during the class we got the kit. I didn't know what half of the things are, but later on after I checked what they are. We also tried to set up a small powered LED, during which we burned 2 LED-s. This was the day on which I learned you can actually burn an LED. Surprisingly we didn't blow up the capacitor.
