During the lecture, I connected the m5stickc with the old laptop. Then I sent messages to m5sticker in my computer, while it didn't connnect with my computer, but messages still displayed on the m5stickc. This process is based on mqtt.

But I met a issue during this period, the message i sent didn't display on the m5stickc. That is because I didn't type down the node on the command line.
