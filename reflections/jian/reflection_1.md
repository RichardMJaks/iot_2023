IoT stands for Internet of Things. It refers to a network of interconnected devices that can communicate and exchange data with each other over the internet, without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

In IoT, everyday objects or devices are embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity features that enable them to collect and exchange data. These devices can range from simple household appliances like smart thermostats and light bulbs to complex industrial machinery and medical devices.
