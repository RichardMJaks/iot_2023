Through the lecture, I know that Grafana is an open-source analytics and monitoring platform that allows you to query, visualize, and alert on your data. It is commonly used for monitoring systems and infrastructure metrics, application performance, and business analytics. It provides  a wide variety of visualization options, including graphs, charts, tables, and gauges. You can customize the appearance of your visualizations with different colors, themes, and styles.

During the lab, I demo how to implement communication on the localhost, iotempower, between localhost and iotempower, by mqtt. But i didn't know how to use wildcard.
