Through the lecture, I know that Node-RED is an open-source flow-based programming tool designed for visual programming and IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It provides a browser-based flow editor that allows users to wire together devices, APIs, and online services to create IoT applications quickly and easily.


And I try to implement it during the lab. That is very useful, i just drag and drop nodes onto a canvas, connect them together, and configure their behavior through a web browser interface.
