Lecture:
We reviewed the kit!
Unfortunately, my team burned out 2 diodes due to incorrect connection, but we gained experience on how to work correctly with circuits (and diodes are the cheapest thing that could have been burned here).
So, 12 volts and 3.5 are quite different things.
Overall, it was very interesting to look at the all contents of the kit. The basic set of components is already impressive, but we will need some additional items for our project.

Home education:
I made a basic blinking circuit with a regular diode. It was quite challenging because I encountered some problems:

1) My program refused to automatically download all the software packages for interacting with the ESP8266, so I had to manually specify the path for downloading all the drivers in the settings.
2) The laptop refused to automatically download the drivers for the required USB port, so I also had to manually install them.

These were not complex problems, a few minutes on Reddit were enough to find solutions to all my issues.

However, with the next circuit on the RGB diode, I decided not to rush: in the video I found on Ulno's channel about building such connections, it was necessary to use 3 resistors for each of the 3 color contacts, whereas our kit only had one such resistor. Knowing how easy it is to burn out such a diode, I decided to ask about it in the lecture.
