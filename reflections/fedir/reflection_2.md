We reviewed the kit!
Unfortunately, my team burned out 2 diodes due to incorrect connection, but we gained experience on how to work correctly with circuits (and diodes are the cheapest thing that could have been burned here).
So, 12 volts and 3.5 are quite different things.
Overall, it was very interesting to look at the all contents of the kit. The basic set of components is already impressive, but we will need some additional items for our project.
