As students in this class, we agree to present our skills in using and understanding publish/subscribe with a focus on MQTT, IoT testing (simulators), and integration with MQTT and Node-RED in the following ways:
- We create a subscriber (laptop) and a publisher (ESP8266)
- Subscriber receives movement data from the publisher
- Subscriber prints the data to stdout

- (M) Fill in the form [https://forms.gle/Pvaw8h5CDU1GrySaA](https://forms.gle/Pvaw8h5CDU1GrySaA) when you pick up hardware from us. i.e (Laptop or Raspberry Pi)
