# What is IoT?

Internet of Things is a concept, where everything within a network is connected. The network can be as large as the whole world, and as small as two microcontrollers connected via an ethernet cable.

The concept of IoT means that devices within a network can work in tandem, adding new value to some devices which had very little value previously. This unified work can use simple components to create complex interconnected systems.

It is just like a magic that turns everyday objects into smart, interconnected devices, allowing them to communicate, share data, and bring a touch of enchantment to our homes and cities.

Main purpose of IoT is to make our life simpler, better and more efficient, so we wouldn't have to waste so much time doing simple everyday tasks.
