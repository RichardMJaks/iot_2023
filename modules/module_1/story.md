Characters:
AI: Ail
Person: Dick

Story:
The first day Dick gets a Discord message that there is a gas leakage detected at his house. He spends the night at his friend's house.
The second day after Dick comes home from a tiring workday as a single middle-aged man, he just wants some comfort.
After he unlocks the door with an nfc card, he is greeted by Ail, his AI voice-assistant over the speaker.
After Ail has greeted him, it tells him if he should turn on the heater or open the windows if the house is too hot or too cold, and tells him if the plants have been watered.
Dick can talk to Ail from anywhere inside the house where there is a microphone.
Dick thinks that his plants still need watering, so he tells Ail to water them, which it does by pumping some water using the installed water pumps.
He knows he has to wake up early tomorrow, so he tells Ail to wake him up at 08:00 and incase also set an alarm for 08:15, which it does.
Now Dick wants to interact with Ail a bit more, so he puts on his VR headset and turns it on.
Then he sees Ail being there, and he can converse with it in-person.
He can also move around the house and watch a movie with Ail, even though it doesn't understand what's going on, but just sitting beside him and giving him company.
After watching a movie he goes to bedroom, where a motion sensor detects it and Ail tells him good night, as it is evening.
The next morning Ail wakes him up and also reminds him to eat breakfast.
After he leaves the house, Ail tells him good bye.
He goes to work, and during the workday, he gets a Discord message from Ail.
It says that it detected a possible fire at his house.
